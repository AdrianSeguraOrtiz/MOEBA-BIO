/**
 * Implementation of the Ayadi scoring metric for comparing biclusters.
 * This metric evaluates the similarity between sets of biclusters based on a product
 * of intersections over a product of unions for rows and columns separately,
 * which is a method detailed in the publication:
 * Wassim Ayadi, Ons Maatouk, and Hend Bouziri. 2012. Evolutionary biclustering algorithm of gene expression data.
 * In International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications. IEEE, 206â€“210. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1109/dexa.2012.46
 * 
 * This class extends MetricInterface and calculates the overall score based on this specific implementation.

     * of their row and column sets divided by the product of the unions of their row and column sets.
